The project was built in stages up to task 4. Each stage can be seen in the reports, 0,1,2,3.
Throughout the project stages we work with csv files converted to kml to display them in Google Maps using algorithms and filtering. 
The files contain records of scans of wireless networks including names, power location and more as we focus on the 10 strongest records of each scan by time. 
The program has a graphical interface for controlling data, written in java, in a mac work environments, also folds in gradle In addition the project supports updating the data through connection to an external SQL server.
